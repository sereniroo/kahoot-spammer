# sirtomato999's Kahoot Spammer
My kahoot spammer is a simple multi-threaded kahoot spammer.   
It still has some kinks that I would like to work out, especially the fact that each Selenium webdriver eats up RAM (~200M?).   
Well, even if it barely works, here it is!    
`Usage: kahootspam.py <game pin> <number of bots>`
   
   Requirements: Python 3, Selenium Webdriver, Chromium (not Chrome) for chromedriver
